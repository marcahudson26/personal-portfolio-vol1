            <h3 id="About-me"> About me</h3>
            <p>Hello, I'm Marc. Up until recently I was a HGV driver, I have recently discovered my love for coding. I
                started my
                journey to become a front-end web developer in October 2022. I decided to pursue my interest in
                programming
                with help of family members who are software engineers. I have dedicated my spare time to learning these
                new skills.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout this experience so far I have enjoyed paying attention to the small details. I am currently
                enrolled in a skills
                bootcamp into front-end web development. I'm fairly new to programming but spend as much of my free time
                researching JavaScript and HTML/CSS as these particularly interest me.
            </p>
            <p>I like using CSS to style pages and make them user friendly. I am constantly learning new techniques
                to improve my work; in my projects below you can see my portfolio Vol 1 which I look at to just remind
                me how far I have come in this short time period.
            </p>
            <p>My ambition is to eventually become a lead front-end engineer. It will take a lot of time, however, I
                will not
                stop putting the effort and time in until I reach my goal. I have pet projects to experiment with as
                well as
                pair-programmes to try understand how best to work in a team of developers. This helps me gain insight
                into
                good programming practices.
            </p>
            <p>I hope to eventually solve real-world problems using technology, and finally kick-start a career in
                tech.
            </p>
